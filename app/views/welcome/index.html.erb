    <h1> Overview  </h1>

    <p>
    The goal of this app is to make medical data, specifically medical guidelines, easily accessible.

    </p>
    <p>
    Medical Guidelines are a wealth of information for doctors, 
    however, many doctors don't know they exist and they're often difficult to find.
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    This app provides an API that lists the currently available medical 
    guidelines.

    </p>

    <p>
    If you want to see a list of all guidelines, run the command below.  This 
    is a versioned API, however, if you don't specify a version, it will 
    default to the version 1.  That means you're not required to specify a 
    version at this point.
    </p>


    <div class="code">
    curl  -H "accept: application/vnd.api+json" https://med-data-depot.herokuapp.com/guidelines | python -m json.tool  
    </div>

    <p>
    You can also view a single medical guideline excerpt.  Currently, the API will
    provide the HTML code pertaining to the guideline recommendation.
    Ultimately, this will be consumed by a mobile application. Below is an example
    of an API call to view a single guideline.
    </p>

    <div class="code">
    curl  -H "accept: application/vnd.api+json" https://med-data-depot.herokuapp.com/guidelines/7 | python -m json.tool  
    </div>
